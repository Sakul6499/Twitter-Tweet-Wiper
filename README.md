# Twitter Tweet Wiper

This [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) uses a `tweets.js` from your Twitter archive and wipes **all** tweets.  
To use this project simply:

1. Request an archive on Twitter (Settings > Personal > Request Archive) & wait for it to be ready
2. Download your archive
3. Open it and extract the `tweets.js`. Place this file inside this directory.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook.

**THIS WILL WIPE ALL YOUR TWEETS.**  
**There is no way of recovering them, except for extracting from your archive and re-posting each tweet.**
